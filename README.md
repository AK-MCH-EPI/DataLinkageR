# DataLinkageR
A simple example using the RecordLinkage package in R was shared at the 2018 CityMatCH conference.

All names are made up by me, and any similarity are entirely due to chance.

About the files:

IMPORTANT: I suggest downloading the files or copying the code from the RLink_code.R file into your own R script. If you choose to clone or download the package and want to run this locally, you'll have to update the paths for the files in the code used as I updated the code to run from the GitHub URL.

RLinkCityMatCH.html is the presentation given. Download it to view it.  
  
RLink_code.R is the R code used for the example. Download it to run the R code.  
    - I highly suggest running the code line by line and paying attention to my comments.  
    
Datasets/lists 
  - DataSetA.csv and DataSetB.csv are the two sets to be linked
  - MatchTruthFull.csv contains the truth in the linkages between the datasets
  - pairs.1cm.csv is the manually reviewed dataset.
  - p.1.RData is the list object training data to use in the machine learning
